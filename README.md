# Flight911 Project Plan

## 1. Project Overview
Flight911 is a web application that enables users to track real-time flight data and receive emergency alerts. The app aims to help travelers, aviation enthusiasts, and professionals stay informed about flight statuses and incidents.

## 2. Goals & Objectives
- Provide real-time flight tracking and status updates.
- Alert users to flight emergencies or incidents.
- Offer a user-friendly dashboard for flight search and visualization.

## 3. Core Features (MVP)
- Search for flights by number or location.
- Display real-time flight status (departure, arrival, delays).
- Emergency notification system for flight incidents.
- Interactive dashboard (map and list views).

## 4. Stretch Goals (Post-MVP)
- Historical flight data analysis.
- User authentication and saved preferences.
- Push/email notifications.
- Mobile app version.

## 5. Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js (or Vue.js)
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express (or Python/Flask)
- **API/Data Source:** OpenSky, AviationStack, or FlightAware
- **Database:** MongoDB or PostgreSQL (for user data/historical information)
- **Hosting:** Vercel, Netlify, or AWS

## 7. Tasks Breakdown

### Research & Planning
- Identify APIs for flight data and emergencies.
- Define user stories and flows.

### Design
- Create wireframes for search, dashboard, and details pages.
- Decide on branding and UI kit.

### Development
- Set up frontend project and routing.
- Integrate backend with flight data API.
- Build search and tracking features.
- Implement alert system for emergencies.
- Create dashboard with map/list views.

### Testing & QA
- Write unit tests for frontend and backend.
- Conduct usability testing.

### Deployment
- Deploy MVP to chosen hosting platform.
- Prepare documentation for users and contributors.

## 8. Risks & Mitigation

- **API Limitations:** Choose APIs with generous free tiers; plan for caching and rate-limiting.
- **Data Privacy:** Ensure compliance with data protection laws for user information.
- **Scalability:** Design backend for future growth (e.g., microservices, cloud hosting).

## 9. Success Criteria

- Users can reliably search and track flights.
- Emergency alerts are timely and accurate.
- Positive user feedback on dashboard usability.
